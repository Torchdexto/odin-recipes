    <h2>Juicy and tasty chicken that you can make in 15 minutes!</h2>
    <p>Continuing the garlic theme from the previous <a href="../recipes/garlic_bread.html">garlic bread</a> recipe, 
        we're now going to look at how to make this amazing honey and garlic chicken. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tsp. olive oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced </li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>3 tbsp. honey</li>
    <li>3 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes (adjust to your liking)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Season diced chicken with salt and pepper, (Keep in mind soy sauce will also add sodium.)</li>
    <li>Add chicken to skillet and brown on one side, about 3-4 minutes. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze. Whisk the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and red pepper flakes in small bowl until well combined. </li>
